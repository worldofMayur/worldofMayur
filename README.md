- 👋 Hi, I’m @worldofMayur <br />
   Ever since I discovered the magic of code, I've been hooked. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking an idea and turning it into a reality through programming. <br />
   
- 👀 I’m interested in Chasing the Coding Dream <br />
   Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of full-stack development. Frontend, backend, you name it – I'm eager to master it all!  Building captivating user interfaces and robust backends is my current obsession. <br />
   
- 🌱 I’m currently improving technical skills <br />
   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frameworks like React and Angular on the horizon!) <br />
   Backend: Exploring languages like Python, Java, and Node.js to build powerful APIs and applications. <br />
   Database Wrangling: Learning the ropes of SQL and NoSQL databases (MongoDB?) to store and manage data like a pro. <br />
